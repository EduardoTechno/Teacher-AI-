# 🚀 Aventura Espacial Educativa - Virtual Tutor for Kids

Welcome to **Aventura Espacial Educativa**, a playful and interactive web application designed to teach basic math to primary school children through an outer space adventure. The interface combines audio, animation, and a friendly alien tutor to enhance the learning experience.

> 🌟 This was a personal academic project built with Flask, HTML/CSS/JS and multimedia content. It's no longer maintained, but remains part of my portfolio as a showcase of my skills in web development and AI integration.
